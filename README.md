# Marvel MVP App

This App is for Marvel fans who want to search for Marvel movies that include their favorite Marvel characters. Will also include a timeline of Marvel movies.

## Objectives

- Create a front end.
- Connect to an external API.
- Build a database.

## Setup

### Dependencies

Run `nvm use 16` in both the project and client folders.

Run `npm install` in the project folder to install dependencies related to Express (the server).

`cd client` and run `npm install` install dependencies related to React (the client).

### Database Prep

Create `.env` file in project directory and add

```
DB_NAME=todos
DB_PASS=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

(replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual password)

Alternatively, you can rename the provided `.env.example` file to `.env`.

Type `mysql -u root -p` to access the MySQL CLI using your password.

In the MySQL CLI, type `create database todos;` to create a database in MySQL.

Run the following in the MySQL CLI: `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';` (replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual password)

Run `node model/database.js` in your **TERMINAL**, in the **project** folder (not your MySQL CLI! Open a new terminal window for this). This will create a table called 'items' in your database.

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd client` and run `npm start` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
- Client is configured so all API calls will be proxied to port 5000 for a smoother development experience. Yay!
- You can test your client app in `http://localhost:3000`
- You can test your API in `http://localhost:5000/api`
